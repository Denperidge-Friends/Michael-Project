			<h2>Introduction to spirituality</h2>
			<p>
				Vietnamese people have long believed in the existence of a supernatural world. There exist spirits and deities who controlled everything and exerted a great influence on the course of human life. Plants, animals and man are believed to have souls.

			<p>
				Human beings possess three souls (hon) commanding the superior functions and seven vital principles (phach) concerning the visceral functions, but plants only have the soul-life (sinh hon), and the animals merely have an additional sensory (giac hon).  Man is the only creature having a transcendental soul which possesses the capacity for survival. 
				<br>
				There are 4 main deities in Vietnamese lore: Sơn Tinh (山精) the god of Tản Viên Mountain, Phù Đổng Thiên Vương (扶董天王, also known as Thánh Gióng, Ông Dóng) a giant who defeated northern invaders, Chử Đồng Tử (褚童子) a sage, and Princess Liễu Hạnh (柳杏公主), a heavenly spirit and Mother Goddess.
				Each of the four immortals has association with helping historical national figures.

			</h2>		
			<p>
				Vietnam possesses a rich mixture of religions, which reflects the influence of many cultures. Among major religions in Vietnam, there are six official ones: Buddhism, Catholicism, Islam, Protestantism, and two indigenous religious traditions emerging during the colonial period, Cao Dai and Hoa Hao. In addition, Hinduism is also a prevailing religion followed by the Cham ethnic minority in the Southern Vietnam. According to the constitution, every Vietnamese citizen is given the freedom of religion, but their right is often constrained, particularly with regard to any religious activities that could become a forum for dissent. Each religion with its particular practice and rituals not only makes Vietnamese spiritual life more colorful and unique but also has a profound impact on the people as well as their culture.
