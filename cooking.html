			<h2>Introduction to cooking</h2>
			<p>
				Vietnam has plenty of dishes coming from 63 provinces and cities along the country to win the heart of both domestic and international connoisseurs in food. Until now, Vietnam food is also regarded as one of the healthiest cuisines all over the world. As people usually say, "Vietnamese food is not only food, it is Vietnamese culture". Vietnamese food is a harmonious combination of five basic spices: spicy, sour, sweet, salty, and bitter creating its distinctive flavour. Also, it makes a huge impact on diners with 5 senses: food arrangement, appealing food arrangement appealing to eyes, sounds coming from crisp ingredients, five spices lingering on the tongue, aromatic ingredients from herbs attracting the nose and some food merely being perceived by touching.

			<h2>Vietnamese Mung Bean Dumplings:</h2>
			<img src="images/Mung_bean_dumplings.jpg" alt="An image of mung bean dumplings">
			
			<div class="instructions">
				<h3>For the beans:</h3>
				<p>
					Soak mung beans for two hours in warm water or overnight in cold water, then drain. Transfer to a large pot, add 1 tsp salt and fill water. Bring to a boil, then lower to simmer. Once the water is mostly gone, bring down to the lowest heat possible and cover, allowing the beans to soak up the remaining water and soften completely. Mash until it's the consistency of mashed potatoes.
				</p>

				<h3>For the onion oil:</h3>
				<p>
					Gently heat 1/3 cup vegetable oil with sliced onions to get the onion flavour. Cook until the onions are soft and falling apart. Strain out onion to add to the cooked mung beans. Similarly, make the green onion oil by gently heating the oil then removing from heat for the onions to cook.
				</p>

				<h3>For the filling:</h3>
				<p>
					Remove mung beans from heat after 25-30 minutes. Add the strained onions and 1 tsp black pepper. Mix until incorporated. Roll into 1 inch balls and set aside.
				</p>

				<h3>For the dough:</h3>
				<p>
					Mix together glutinous rice flour, salt and 3 tbsp onion oil. Add water 1/2 cup at a time until a dough forms. It should be a little tacky, but not stick to your fingers.
					Take about 2-3 tbsp sized chunks of the dough and pinch out to just under 1/4 inch thickness to make 3 inch circles. Wrap the 1 inch bean balls until covered, pinching off any excess dough. Use oil on your hands to keep the dough from sticking, and add a little extra water if you find the dough gets dry or crumbly.
				</p>

				<h3>For cooking the dumplings:</h3>
				<p>
					When the dumplings are all made, cook them by boiling a large pot of water with 1/2 tsp of salt and 2 tbsp of regular oil (not onion oil). Once at a rolling boil, cook the dumplings in batches, gently stirring occasionally to keep the dumplings from sticking together. Wait until they float to the top for about a minute or two before removing from the water.
