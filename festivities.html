				Vietnamese Lunar New Year (Tet Nguyen Dan):
			</h2>	
			<p>
				The purpose of this holiday is that Vietnamese would like to thank Gods for the arrival of spring with a great variety of blooming flowers & trees after a harsh and cold winter. This is also the privileged occasion for pilgrims to pagodas and temples and family's members to reunite to celebrate a new year together, hope for a better upcoming year and say farewell to the previous year. Cleaning, eating, and being with family are the main activities for Tet.

				Mid-Autumn's Festival (Trung Thu):
			</h2>		
			<p>
				Mid-Autumn (Trung Thu) is the day when the moon is at its brightest in a year. In that spirit, to worship the Moon Genie, there comes the celebration of Mid-Autumn's Festival.
				<br>
				Through times, Mid-Autumn’s Festival gradually becomes an event providing children with a rich diversity of delightful traditional games and entertaining activities, offering great help in promoting education as well as culture.
				<br>
				Before the Holiday, moon cakes made from sticky rice and colourful lanterns in different forms of star, boats, dragons, and so on are made to serve in the festival. On a special day, at night, mid-autumn festive parties with Banh Nuong and Banh Deo (in the shape of moon and fish), candies and fruits are held at every residential area. Moreover, traditional games like hide and seek, lantern marching, and lion dancing are organized for children to fully participate in.
